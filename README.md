# Smart Innovative Recycling (Recycle)

## Overview

Smart Innovative Recycling is an advanced system aimed at revolutionizing the recycling process through intelligent technology. 
The system employs sophisticated machine learning algorithms to accurately classify and sort recyclable materials, enhancing efficiency and reducing human error. 
By training on extensive datasets, the algorithms can distinguish between various materials such as plastics, metals, paper, and glass, ensuring precise sorting and
categorization.
To facilitate user interaction and provide real-time data monitoring, the project incorporates a mobile application developed in Kotlin.
This application offers an intuitive interface for users, allowing them to interact with the recycling system seamlessly. Users can monitor the classification process, 
receive notifications, and access historical data, all in real-time.

Additionally, the project utilizes SQL for robust database management, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of recycling data. The SQL database supports complex queries
and maintains data integrity, crucial for generating reports and analyzing recycling trends. This integration of machine learning, mobile technology, and efficient data 
management creates a comprehensive solution that enhances the recycling process, promotes sustainability, and provides valuable insights for continuous improvement. 
Smart Innovative Recycling represents a significant step forward in waste management, combining cutting-edge technology with practical application to address environmental
challenges.
